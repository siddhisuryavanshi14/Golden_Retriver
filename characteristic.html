		<font size="+2"><p>The Golden Retriever is a medium-large, strongly built breed with a dense, 
		water-repellant wavy coat. As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, and 
		owing to its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged 
		in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical 
		variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or 
		gold in colour, and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.</p>

			<dd>British-type Golden Retrievers are prevalent throughout Europe and Australia.
			The skull is broader and the forequarters are more muscular than in other types.
			The muzzle is balanced and well chiseled. The coat is generally lighter in colour
			than in the American types. Males stand between 22 to 24 in (56 to 61 cm) at the 
			withers; females are between 20 to 22 in (51 to 56 cm). Acceptable or expected 
			weights are not specified in the UK standard, but the Kennel Club standard calls 
		 	for a level topline and straight hindquarters without the slight rear angulation
			found in American lines.

			<p>The eyes are round and dark, which is in contrast to the triangular or slanted
			composition of their American counterparts. British Golden Retrievers can have a 
			coat colour of any shade of gold or cream; red or mahogany are not permitted. 
			Originally, cream was an unacceptable colour in the UK standard, but the standard
			was revised in 1936 to include cream. At the time of this revision, the exclusion
			of cream as a colour was agreed to as a mistake, as the original "yellow" 
			retrievers of the 19th century were actually lighter in colour than was permitted
 			by the standards used before 1936. As with American lines, white is an 
			unacceptable colour in the show ring.[16] The British Kennel Club standard is 
			used in all countries except the US and Canada.[15] Golden retrievers have 
			muscular bodies with great endurance, owing to their origins as hunting and 
			gundogs.</p></dd>
			<dt>American</dt>
			<dd>American types are lankier and less muscular than other types, males stand 
			between 23 and 24 in (58 and 61 cm) in height at the withers; females are 21.5 to 
			22.5 in (55 to 57 cm) tall. Their coats are darker in colour and occur in various 
			shades of lustrous gold with moderate feathering. When trotting, they have a free,
			smooth, powerful, and well-coordinated gait; as the dog runs, its feet converge 
			towards the center of the line of balance.[17] The American standard also makes 
			requirements about the proportion, substance, head and skull, neck, body, topline,
			forequarters, and hindquarters; in these respects, the American-type Retriever is 
			the same as Golden Retrievers that conform to other national standards. American 
			breeders of Golden Retrievers sometimes import their dogs from Britain to take 
			advantage of the temperament and appearance of the British types.</dd>
			<dt>Canadian</dt>
			<dd>The Canadian Golden Retriever has a thinner and darker coat and stands taller
			than other types. Males stand 23 and 24 in (58 and 61 cm) in height at withers; 
			and females 21.5 to 22.5 in (55 to 57 cm). Weight for males is between 29–34 kg 
			(65-75 lb); and females between 27–32 kg (60-70 lb).</dd>
